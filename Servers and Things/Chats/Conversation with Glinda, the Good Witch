It's me, Glinda the Good Witch of Oz! You found me and ruined my genius plan!

You see, I cast a magic spell on the Abominable Snow Monster to make him throw 
all the snowballs at the North Pole. Why? Because I knew a giant snowball fight 
would stir up hostilities between the Elves and the Munchkins, resulting in 
all-out WAR between Oz and the North Pole. I was going to sell my magic and 
spells to both sides. War profiteering would mean GREAT business for me.

But, alas, you and your sleuthing foiled my venture. And I would have gotten 
away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!
