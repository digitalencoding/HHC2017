message  Message Body: 

Hey Mrs Claus,

Do you have that awesome gingerbread cookie recipe you made for me last 
year? You sent it in a MS word .docx file. I would totally open that 
docx on my computer if you had that. I would click on anything with the 
words gingerbread cookie recipe in it. I'm totally addicted and want to 
make some more.

Thanks,
Alabaster Snowball

are completely secure and impenetrable.

Should we be worried about this?

I tried it on my local machine and was able to transfer a file. Here's
